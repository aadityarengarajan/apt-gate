# aptgate
Since there are no open-source datasets for airport gates on the internet, this uses PDF scraping and webscraping to generate a random real gate number based on charts from discord AvBot.

# how to use
Run aptgate.py in an IDE and it will print to you a random gate from a given airport

# why
Starting up your flight sim and don't know which gate to spawn at? Use this!
